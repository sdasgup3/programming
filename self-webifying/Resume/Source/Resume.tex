                                  \texttt{Abstract: } Implemented a PRE
                                  optimization pass in LLVM and measured results
                                  on a variety of applications and did a detailed 
                                  study on the performance numbers.

                                data flow information can be represented using

                                vector frameworks because they are
                                non-separable e.g., faint variable analysis,
                                possible undefined variable analysis, strongly

                                  achieved a slowdown of 2X w.r.t the execution time of statically compiled C
                                  language. This is obtained by providing built-in compiled functions 
                                  for simple graph computation which in turn help to build complex
                                  ones.

          \item \textbf{Mitigating Impact of Heterogeneity Across Power-constrained Nodes on Parallel Applications through Load Balancing}     
                                \href{http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~sdasgup3/Document/report_cs533.pdf}{[Report]}
                                \href{https://github.com/sdasgup3/heterogeneity-aware-load-balancing}{[Github]} \\
                                  \texttt{Abstract: }Different processors across the nodes
                                  have different execution times for the same
                                  work-loads. This performance imbalance is seen
                                  only when the CPU power is capped to low
                                  values. This performance imbalance causes
                                  increased execution times of the parallel
                                  applications. We did a detailed study and
                                  proposed a power aware load balancer (using
                                      Charm++ ) which minimized the performance
                                  imbalance at the lower power caps by tackling
                                  this heterogeneity.

                                \texttt{Abstract: } Developed a superscalar processor (with  an
                                    issue rate of 2) using verilog hdl, and an
                                assembler for that processor using flex and
                                bison.

                                  in parallel in Charm++. Some of the
                                  challenges for efficient exploration of space
                                  by chares include intelligent pruning of the
                                  state space, load balancing, grain-size
                                  control and low-overhead communication
                                  between chares. Evaluated multiple options
                                  for each of these, and come up with design
                                  decisions which would work for a large
                                  category of real-life graph applications.

			\item[] To Extend the Generic Data Flow Analyzer GDFA (of gcc) to the data flow frameworks where data flow information can
				be represented using bit vectors but the frameworks are not bit vector frameworks because they are non-separable e.g.,
				faint variable analysis, possible undefined variable analysis, strongly live variable analysis.

			\item[] To design a customized processor (using parallel processing concepts) for the application of document retrieval
				system. We developed a \href{https://github.com/sdasgup3/parallel-processor-design}{superscalar processor (with  an issue rate of 2)} using verilog hdl, and an assembler for that processor using flex and bison.
